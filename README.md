# Perceiving Systems Overview
Perceiving Systems is a leading Computer Vision research group in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

Our core research focuses on learning digital humans that can perceive, learn, and act in virtual 3D worlds. This involves capturing the shape, appearance, and motion of real people as well as their interactions with each other and the 3D scene. Using this, we learn generative models of people and their behavior and evaluate these models by synthesizing realistic looking humans behaving in virtual worlds.
